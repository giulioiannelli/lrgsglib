# IsingSimulator C Programs

Several variants of `IsingSimulator` are provided to run Monte Carlo
dynamics on random-bond Ising systems. Each program reads simulation
parameters from the command line and writes results to binary files.

Build all simulators with `make c-make`; the executables will appear in
`src/lrgsglib/Ccore/bin/`.
